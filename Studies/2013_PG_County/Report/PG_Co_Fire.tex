\chapter{Introduction}
\pagenumbering{arabic}
\setcounter{page}{1}
Part of the function of the Fire Research Division at NIST is to develop and apply technology, measurements, and standards to improve the understanding of the behavior, prevention, and control of fires to enhance fire fighting operations and equipment, fire suppression, fire investigations, and disaster response. NIST has previously used the Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS) fire model to provide insight into the fire development and thermal conditions of fires that have resulted in line of duty deaths (LODDs)~\cite{Madrzykowski:1,Iowa,Texas,Bryner:Charleston,barowy:texas,Weinschenk:Chicago}. The objective of these studies has been to improve the safety and effectiveness of firefighters.

On February 24, 2012, a fire in residential structure injured seven Prince George's County firefighters. NIST examined the fire dynamics of this incident at the request of the Prince George's Country Fire/Emergency Medical Services (EMS) Department. Computer simulations of the fire incident were conducted using the NIST Fire Dynamics Simulator~\cite{FDS_Users_Guide} and Smokeview~\cite{Smokeview_Users_Guide}  software to provide insight into the fire development and thermal conditions that likely existed in the residence during the fire. The specific objectives of the simulations detailed in this report are: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item To examine the effect of the flow path (including temperature, pressure, and fire conditions) in this multi-story residential structure using physics-based calculations.
\item To provide visualizations of the fire behavior that are representative of the conditions that members of the Prince George's Fire Department likely experienced during the course of their interior operations.
\end{enumerate}

This document describes the input and the results of the FDS (version 6.1.1) simulations. The simulations were developed using a combination of knowledge of the fire scenario and appropriate engineering approximations and assumptions. Analysis of the simulation results focuses on the hazardous conditions that developed following the development of a flow path inside of the structure. This document is organized as follows: Section~\ref{fire_sum} provides a summary of the fire incident, Section~\ref{model} describes the relevant model input parameters and assumptions that were used to develop the simulations, Section~\ref{results} presents the simulation results, and Section~\ref{discuss} discusses the simulation results as they relate to firefighter safety and effectiveness. Appendix~\ref{app_draw} contains dimensioned drawings of the basement and first floor of the structure.


\chapter{Fire Incident Summary}
\label{fire_sum}
The account of events for this incident was documented by the Safety Investigation Team of the Prince George's County Fire/EMS Department~\cite{PGCounty2013}. At 21:11 hours on February 24, 2012 Prince George's Fire/EMS Department responded to a structure fire in Riverdale Heights, Maryland with a fire in the basement~\cite{PGCounty2013}. For the purpose of this analysis, the details regarding the timeline are considered to be approximate values. The Prince George's County report~\cite{PGCounty2013} includes narratives of actions of the response personnel. The following narrative of the incident, focused on the events which led to burn injuries to two emergency-personnel, was taken from the Prince George's County report~\cite{PGCounty2013}:
\begin{quote}
Truck 809 responded from quarters, as the first due truck company, and arrived on 57th Avenue right behind Engine 807B. When Truck 809 stopped to let Engine 807B layout, Truck 809 Can dismounted the truck and had to walk up the street as it pulled away. Truck 809 Officer observed a lot of smoke moving extremely fast through the front yard and across the street upon exiting the truck. Truck 809 Officer and Truck 809 Forcible Entry proceeded directly to the front door \ldots of the structure. Both of them entered the structure with full PPE, including SCBA, but without the protection of a hose line. Truck 809 Officer and Truck 809 Forcible Entry began primary searches on the first floor. At some point during the primary search, as conditions worsened, the front door closed, trapping Truck 809 Officer and Truck 809 Forcible Entry inside the structure. This situation could not have occurred if a charged hose line was operating inside the structure at the time the door slammed shut. They were the only firefighters operating on the first floor at that time. 

Truck 809 Forcible Entry was too large in physical stature to fit through the small window opening that he found on [the front of the structure]. Truck 809 Forcible Entry was unable to self-evacuate, and remained trapped inside. Due to rapidly deteriorating conditions, Truck 809 Officer was forced to self-rescue through another small window on [the front of the structure]. 

After exiting the structure, Truck 809 Officer screamed (to those on the exterior) that a firefighter was trapped inside. Truck 809 Officer then proceeded to the front door \ldots in an attempt to search for and rescue Truck 809 Forcible Entry, who was trapped inside. At this point multiple firefighters on the exterior assisted Truck 809 Officer in the search, rescue, and removal of Truck 809 Forcible Entry. Both Truck 809 Officer and Truck 809 Forcible Entry sustained serious injuries and were transported to MedStar/Washington Hospital Center. 

While the interior operations were occurring, Truck 809 Driver and Truck 809 Hook/Ladders were on the exterior throwing ladders to the structure. Truck 809 Hook/Ladders threw two ladders [front and left side], while Truck 809 Driver threw one ladder ([front side]). 
\end{quote}  
From a combination of on-scene video and the narrative accounts from the Prince George's County Fire/EMS Department report~\cite{PGCounty2013}, Table~\ref{tab:fire_info} shows an overview of the timeline of events. Table~\ref{tab:fire_info} represents the best estimate of the events and therefore all times should be considered as approximate.

\chapter{Model Description}
\label{model}
Fire Dynamics Simulator~\cite{FDS_Users_Guide} is a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model that solves a form of the Navier-Stokes equations appropriate for low-speed, thermally driven flow with an emphasis on smoke and heat transport from fires.  Within a CFD model, the room or building is divided into small three-dimensional rectangular control volumes or computational cells.  The cells are contained together within one larger volume known as a computational domain.  The CFD model computes the density, velocity, temperature, pressure, and species concentration of the gas in each cell.  Based on the laws of conservation of mass, momentum,  and energy, the model tracks the generation and movement of fire gasses. One of the most important advantages of FDS is that it is  mathematically verified~\cite{FDS_Verification_Guide} and validated against fire test data to ensure that it provides the expected results, given sufficient input data~\cite{FDS_Validation_Guide}. A complete description of the FDS model is provided in the FDS Technical Reference Guide~\cite{FDS_Math_Guide}.

Smokeview is a software tool designed to visualize simulation results from FDS~\cite{Smokeview_Users_Guide}. Smokeview visualizes smoke and other attributes of the fire simulation using traditional scientific methods such as displaying tracer particle flow, two dimensional (2D) or three dimensional (3D) shaded contours of gas flow data such as temperature and flow vectors showing flow direction and magnitude. Smokeview allows the fire and fire movement to be visualized. This is done by displaying a series of partially transparent planes where the transparencies in each plane (at each grid node) are determined from soot densities computed by FDS. Smokeview also visualizes static data at particular times using 2D or 3D contours of data such as temperature and flow vectors showing flow direction and magnitude.

Input data from various sources must be collected and documented to simulate a fire using FDS or any other fire model. For the simulation results presented in this document, information was obtained from two primary sources. The following information was gathered from the fire scene: the geometry of the building and the compartments being modeled, the size and location of exterior and interior ventilation openings, and documentation of fire damage to the building. The following information was gathered from witnesses, first responders, reports, and recorded media such as fire ground radios or videos: information on the timing of the fire development, the sequence and approximate timing of ventilation openings to the outside, and weather conditions at the time of the fire. 

The analysis of the simulation results is focused on the impact of ventilation. Specifically on the  interior conditions of the first floor following the establishment of a flow path through door control and how wind impacted these conditions. Based on the goals of the analysis and the information collected, several engineering approximations were made. For example, heavy smoke conditions were reported at the front of the house at the time of arrival~\cite{PGCounty2013}; however, the exact ignition time, fire growth rate, and heat release rate (HRR) of the fire were not known. The ignition time and growth rate were estimated to reduce the amount of required calculation time while adhering to event timeline (Table~\ref{tab:fire_info}) and documented observations. The HRR of the fire was estimated using documentation of the potential fuel load within the structure.

\section{Geometry}
\label{geom}
The structure involved in this fire incident was a one story, single-family structure with a basement. The structure was platform-framed wood construction with a gable roof. \footnote{Platform-framed construction means that floor joists are completely covered with a sub-floor. This forms a platform for which walls are built from.} The structure had a first floor footprint of 9.14~m (30~ft) by 7.77~m (25.5~ft) with the basement being slightly smaller, 9.14~m (30~ft) by 7.16~m (23.5~ft), as show in Fig.~\ref{fig:simp_geom}. This resulted in a first floor area of 71~m$^2$ (764~ft$^2$) and a basement floor area of 65~m$^2$ (700~ft$^2$). The interior walls were composed of gypsum board over insulated wood framing.~\cite{PGCounty2013}. There was a single flight of stairs in the center of the structure which connected the first floor to the basement. 

The structure was built on a sloped landscape such that on the front side of the structure the first floor was located above street level but the basement was below street level (Fig.~\ref{fig:slope}). On the rear side of the structure, the slope allowed the basement to be a walkout. Therefore, access to the structure could be made on the front side of the first floor and the rear side of the basement.

\label{fig:slope}
\end{figure}

The fire, which is described in Section~\ref{fire}, started in the basement and spread to the stairs which connect to the first floor. Discussion of the fire's impact on the interior conditions is provided in Section~\ref{results}. Figure~\ref{fig:exterior} shows the exterior of the front and rear of the structure after the incident. Note that the majority of the damage occurred in the basement of the structure. Fully dimensioned drawings of the interior of the basement and first floor are shown in Figs.~\ref{fig:basement} and \ref{fig:first_floor}, respectively.

\section{Fire}
\label{fire}
To estimate the type of fuel, fire size, and structure ventilation, on-scene videos and post-incident reports were used. Based on these sources of information, the FDS model includes two source fire locations in the basement: one fire in the kitchen area and one in the adjecent bathoom. At the time of the fire, the structure was vacant so the the dominant fuel was wood: exposed ceiling joists, subfloor, cabinets, and stairs.

Wood fuel can be represented by the chemical formula, $\C\H_{1.7}\O_{0.74}\N_{0.002}$, with specified yields of carbon monoxide ($y_{\mathrm{CO}}=0.004 \; \mathrm{kg}/\mathrm{kg}$) and soot ($y_{\mathrm{C}}=0.015 \; \mathrm{kg}/\mathrm{kg}$)~\cite{SFPE:Tewarson}. The product yields are expressed in terms of the amount of carbon monoxide or soot emitted per unit mass of fuel consumed (kg/kg) and can be found in the Society of Fire Protection Engineers (SFPE) Handbook~\cite{SFPE:Tewarson}. A balanced chemical reaction for wood combustion can be written as:

\begin{multline}
\C\H_{1.7}\O_{0.74}\N_{0.002} + 4.91(0.208\,\O_{2} + 0.783\,\N_{2} + 0.387\text{\sc{e}-}3\,\C\O_{2} + 0.834\text{\sc{e}-}2\,\H_{2}\O) \\ 
\rightarrow 5.74(0.636\text{\sc{e}-}3\,\C\O + 0.168\,\C\O_{2} + 0.155\,\H_{2}\O + 0.670\,\N_{2} + 0.613\text{\sc{e}-}2\,\C)
\label{eq:wood_comb}
\end{multline}

The value for the heat of combustion of wood used in this simulation was~16,400 kJ/kg, based on data provided in the SFPE Handbook~\cite{SFPE:Tewarson}. The heat of combustion quantifies the amount of energy per unit mass of the fuel. The following text defines Eq.~\ref{eq:wood_comb} for an FDS input file with the desired fuel and reaction properties discussed above:

\begin{lstlisting}
&SPEC ID='WOOD', FORMULA='CH1.7O0.74N0.002' /

&REAC ID = 'wood' 
    FUEL = 'WOOD', 
    HEAT_OF_COMBUSTION = 16400,
    SOOT_YIELD = 0.015,
    CO_YIELD = 0.004/
\end{lstlisting}

Note that using the input lines above will invoke the simple chemistry reaction mechanism in FDS in which fuel and air react to form only CO$_2$, CO, H$_2$O, soot, and N$_2$. If the inclusion for other combustion products is desired, then the user must explicitly define those species and the chemical reaction that produces them~\cite{FDS_Users_Guide}. Based on the above input lines, FDS uses the default, mixing-controlled fast chemistry combustion model. This mechanism states that the rate of fuel consumption is proportional to both the local limiting reactant concentration and the local rate of mixing and extinction is based on the critical flame temperature approach~\cite{FDS_Math_Guide}. While FDS provides users with the option to use a more complex finite-rate combustion mechanism, there is not sufficient evidence in this case to justify deviating from the default specifications. 

To estimate the heat release rate per unit area (HRRPUA) of wood, Babrauskas and Grayson~\cite{babrauskas1990} conducted experiments in a cone calorimeter\footnote{The cone calorimeter is an experimental apparatus used to gather data about ignition time, mass loss, combustion products, and heat release rate among other properties associated with burning small samples of materials~\cite{ASTM:E1355}.} to determine the 5-min average of the HRRPUA for several different types of wood over a range of radiant heat fluxes. The results of that study indicate that the HRRPUA for different types of wood is approximately 50~kW/m$^2$.

To calculate the total fire size, the appropriate burning area (exposed wood area) of the basement needed to be determined. Based on the floor plan of the structure, the underside of the roof was approximately 134~m$^2$ (1453~ft$^2$) with 7~m$^2$ (75~ft$^2$) walls on the front and rear sides. Additionally, there was 105~m$^2$ (1130~ft$^2$) of floor area in the attic. Examination of post-incident images indicated that the floor immediately over the rear porch burned away. That area was considered to be part of the porch fire. Based on post-incident damage, approximately 50~\% of the remaining floor area and 90~\% of the roof was considered to be fuel for the attic fire. To estimate the total attic fire size, the underside roof area (120~m$^2$), two end walls (14~m$^2$), and the floor area (43~m$^2$ or 463~ft$^2$) were included. Applying an HRRPUA of wood of 50~kW/m$^2$ results in a potential peak fire size of 9~MW. To estimate the size of the porch fire, the four walls of the porch enclosure (42~m$^2$ or 452~ft$^2$) and the floor and ceiling of the porch (24~m$^2$ or 258 ft$^2$) were included, which results in a total porch area of 66~m$^2$ (689~ft$^2$). Using the same HRRPUA of wood of 50~kW/m$^2$, the potential peak fire size on the porch was approximately 3.3~MW. Therefore, the maximum fire size for this structure was estimated to be 12.3~MW. Since the time at which the fire started is not known relative to the notification of a fire or how fast the fire spread, several simplifications were made. The first assumption is that the attic fire was specified to start at the beginning of the simulation and increase to a value of 9~MW in 10~s. The porch fire was specified to start 40~s into the simulation and increase to a value of 3.3~MW in 10~s. The 10-s ramp up time was used to prevent abrupt changes in the velocity at the fire boundary condition in FDS. The second assumption is that the sources of the gas phase wood fuel have constant areas at fixed locations (2 sources for the attic, 1 source for the porch). The following lines define the source fires in the FDS input file:

\begin{lstlisting}
&SURF ID='FIRE', HRRPUA=2250., COLOR='ORANGE', TAU_Q=10 /
&VENT XB=-13.5,-13,1,5,6.16,6.16, SURF_ID='FIRE' / 
&VENT XB=-14.5,-14,1,5,6.16,6.16, SURF_ID='FIRE' / 
&VENT XB=-16.5,-15.5,1,2.5,3.14,3.14, SURF_ID='FIRE', DEVC_ID='SECOND FIRE'/ 
&DEVC XYZ = -17.2,2,0, ID='SECOND FIRE', QUANTITY='TIME', SETPOINT=40, INITIAL_STATE=.FALSE. /
\end{lstlisting}
Note that the coordinates here are unique for the vents are specific to the input files used for these simulations. The key point is that they are 2-D planes located at a specific area.

In reality, the quantities associated with these input parameters are not fixed values; rather, a model input parameter can be thought of as a point estimate from a distribution of possible input parameters with some associated amount of uncertainty. Any change in an input parameter (such as the HRR) for a given scenario would result in a change in the output quantity (such as the hot gas layer (HGL) temperature). For example, according to the McCaffrey, Quintiere, and Harkleroad~\cite{SFPE:Walton} empirical correlation, the HGL temperature in a well-ventilated compartment fire is proportional to the HRR raised to the two-thirds power. Following this relationship, a 7.5~\% increase in the HRR would result in a 5~\% increase in the HGL temperature~\cite{NUREG_1824_Sup_1}. More detailed discussion on the propagation of parameter uncertainty in fire models is available in a validation study that was sponsored by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission~\cite{NUREG_1824_Sup_1}. The following subsections describe the inputs that were used to develop the simulation, including any approximations or assumptions that were made.

While the fires were represented as fuel sources with a constant area (Section~\ref{fire}), from a heat transfer perspective, it is important to define the material properties (density, thermal conductivity, and specific heat) to account for heat transfer and energy storage in the ceiling, walls, and floor. In this study, the material properties of gypsum board~\cite{WAKILI2007} were specified on the finished walls and ceilings on the main two floors of the structure, and the material properties of wood~\cite{Incropera:1} were specified on the unfinished portions of the attic and rear porch. The following lines define these materials in the FDS input file:

\begin{lstlisting}
&MATL ID = 'GYPSUM BOARD'
    FYI = 'Wakili - Journal of Fire Sciences 2007' 
    CONDUCTIVITY = 0.28
    SPECIFIC_HEAT = 1.0
    DENSITY = 810. /

&MATL ID = 'WOOD MAT'
    FYI = 'Incropera and DeWitt, Fundamentals of Heat and Mass Transfer'
    CONDUCTIVITY = 0.12
    SPECIFIC_HEAT = 1.38
    DENSITY = 510. / 
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Ventilation}
\label{Vents}
The simulations in this study account for changes in the ventilation due to a combination of fire department operations (opening doors, breaking windows), fire acting on the structure (fire breaching windows/doors) and wind (restricting flow, closing doors). The ventilation times and ventilation areas represent our best understanding of the incident. The times of ventilation changes for doors and windows are provided in Table~\ref{tab:vents}.

During the time at which the firefighters exited the structure or were rescued from the structure, the state of some windows and doors in the structure was known. The state of the vents (opened versus closed) resulted in the establishment of a flow path in the interior stairwell leading from the basement to the first floor. The exact time of operation for other doors/windows was not known. Therefore, the following the two basement windows on the left rear corner of the structure were assumed to be open at the start of the simulation. The states of the front door and front window were specified at certain times based on observations (i.e. forcible entry, wind effects, forced window breakage) from post-incident reports.

Structure leakage has been shown to be important when modeling enclosure fires~\cite{beal2009}. The open rear basement door and two open windows at the start of the simulation are significantly larger than the total effective area of leakage of a structure of this type. Therefore, any leakage in the structure would have a negligible impact on the fluid mechanics within the structure and is not included in this study.

In addition to the state of openings within the structure, three wind scenarios were considered in this study. Each scenario followed the timeline of events outlined in Table~\ref{tab:vents}. The difference in each scenario is the wind boundary condition. Simulations were run with 0~m/s (0~mph), 4.5~m/s (10~mph), and 8.9~m/s (20~mph) wind velocities, all with a flow direction from the rear toward the front of the structure. Based on local weather conditions, mean wind velocities ranged between 4.5~m/s (10~mph) and 8.9~m/s (20~mph) with gusts up to 13.4~m/s (30~mph)~\cite{PGCounty2013}. The case without wind was run to control for the impact of wind on the flow of hot gases within the structure.

\section{Numerical Mesh}
\label{mesh}
For the simulation, a measure of how well the flow field is resolved can be estimated by using the non-dimensional expression $D^*/\dx$. Here, $D^*$ is the characteristic fire diameter, $\dx$ is the nominal size of a mesh cell, and $\dQ$ is the total heat release rate of the fire:
\begin{equation}
D^* = \left(
     \frac{\dQ}{\rho_\infty \, c_p \, T_\infty \, \sqrt{g}}
     \right)^\frac{2}{5} 
\label{eq:mesh}
\end{equation}   
From the FDS User's Guide~\cite{FDS_Users_Guide}, the characteristic fire diameter is related to the characteristic fire size via the
relation $Q^* = (D^*/D)^{5/2}$. Here, $D$ is the physical diameter of the base of the fire specified in the simulation. Following Eq.~\ref{eq:mesh} and using a grid cell size of 10~cm (3.9~in), the characteristic fire diameter to cell size ($D^*/\dx$) ratio is 12 for the 1.5~MW bathroom fire and 20 for the 6.75~MW basement fire. Based on validation work performed for the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, $D^*/\dx$ values ranged between 4 and 16~\cite{NUREG_1824} and produced results that were adequate for engineering calculations. The grid resolution used in this model is within or exceeds typical engineering $D^*/\dx$ values.

As discussed in Section~\ref{geom}, the structure has dimensions of 9.14~m (30~ft) by 7.62~m (25~ft) and a total height of 7.31~m (24~ft). To sufficiently resolve the wind boundary condtion, the computational domain was extended beyond the volume of the structure. The large domain led to the use of two separate grid resolutions, a 10~cm (3.9~in) resolution and a 20~cm (7.8~in) resolution. The 10~cm resolution encompasses the structure with a total volume 14~m (46~ft) by 12~m (39ft) by 8~m (26~ft) that required a total of 1.3 million computational cells. As a result, all of the input model geometry lengths, ventilation openings (holes, doors, and windows), and fire areas will snap to the nearest 10~cm. The 20~cm grid resolution extends the computational domain 5~m to the left and right sides and 4~m behind the 10~cm mesh to provide sufficient computational domain for the wind profile to develop around the structure. The mesh is coarser to cut down on computational time and because high accuracy in the fluid mechanics of the air flow far from the structure is not important in the analysis of this simulation. The 20~cm resolution resulted in an additional 216,000 computational cells.

Figure~\ref{fig:geom_grid} shows the front and rear of the structure and surrounding domain rendered in Smokeview with the 10~cm and 20~cm meshes. Note the finer mesh (smaller cells) surrounding the structure and the coarser mesh on each side. The domain was divided into 12 equally sized 10~cm meshes that surround the structure (each containing 150,000 grid cells) plus 4 equally sized 20~cm meshes to the left and right of the stucture (each containing 32,000 grid cells) and one 20~cm mesh in the rear of the structure (containing 56,000 grid cells). Multiple meshes allowed the simulation to be processed in parallel, which reduced the amount of required calculation time to approximately 18~hours for the no wind case to 3~days for the 20~mph wind case. Figure~\ref{fig:mult_mesh} shows the entire structure within the computational domain that has been divided into multiple meshes. Table~\ref{tab:mod_param} shows a summary of the model input parameters for the simulations that were conducted as part of this study.

\chapter*{\centering Abstract}

The Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS) fire model, which is developed and maintained by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), was used to provide insight into the dynamics of a fire that occurred on June 2, 2011, within a multi-level, single-family residential structure in San Francisco, CA, that resulted in the death of two firefighters. The inputs for the FDS simulations are documented in this report and are based on the fire scenario, including the building geometry, interior furnishings, and ventilation conditions. The fire started in the basement and resulted in ventilation limited (fuel rich) fire conditions in the basement area.

% The spread of fire and hot gases into the second floor of the structure was limited by a closed steel-faced, wood-framed door. After exposure to the elevated temperatures and pressure from the fire in the porch area, the wood frame of the door decomposed, the steel faces of the door failed, and the door collapsed inward. The door failure resulted in the establishment of a flow path between the higher pressure and higher temperature conditions in the enclosed porch and the lower pressure and lower temperature conditions in the hallway and kitchen areas of the second floor. The temperature of the gases that flowed into the hallway exceeded 260~$^{\circ}$C (500~$^{\circ}$F) at a height of 1.86~m (6~ft). Unfortunately, a captain and firefighter were advancing a hose line in the hallway near the door at the time of the door failure. It appears that the captain was likely overcome by the rapid change in conditions before he could exit to the safety of the kitchen area. After a Mayday call, the captain was rescued from the structure, but later succumbed to his injuries.


\chapter{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

Part of the function of the Fire Research Division at the National Institute of Standars and Technology (NIST) is to develop and apply technology, measurements, and standards to improve the understanding of the behavior, prevention, and control of fires to enhance fire fighting operations and equipment, fire suppression, fire investigations, and disaster response. NIST has previously used the Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS) fire model to provide insight into the fire development and thermal conditions of fires that have resulted in line of duty deaths (LODDs)~\cite{Madrzykowski:1,Iowa,Texas,Bryner:Charleston,barowy:texas,Weinschenk:Chicago}. The objective of these studies has been to improve the safety and effectiveness of firefighters.

On June 2, 2011, a fire in a multi-level, wood-frame residential structure claimed the life of two firefighters of the San Francisco Fire Department. NIST examined the fire dynamics of this incident at the request of NIOSH and the San Francisco Fire Department. Computer simulations of the fire incident were conducted using the NIST Fire Dynamics Simulator~\cite{FDS_Users_Guide} and Smokeview~\cite{Smokeview_Users_Guide} software to provide insight into the fire development and thermal conditions that likely existed in the residence during the fire. The specific objectives of the simulations detailed in this report are: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item To examine the effect of the flow path (including temperature, pressure, and fire conditions) in this multi-level residential structure using physics-based calculations.
\item To provide visualizations of the fire behavior that are representative of the conditions that members of the San Francisco Fire Department likely experienced during the course of their interior operations.
\end{enumerate}
This document describes the input and the results of the FDS (version 6.1.1) simulations. The simulations were developed using a combination of knowledge of the fire scenario and appropriate engineering approximations and assumptions. Analysis of the simulation results focuses on the hazardous conditions that developed following the development of a flow path inside of the structure. This document is organized as follows: Section~\ref{sec:incident_summary} provides a summary of the fire incident, Section~\ref{sec:model_description} describes the relevant model input parameters and assumptions that were used to develop the simulations, Section~\ref{sec:model_results} presents the simulation results, and Section~\ref{sec:discussion} discusses the simulation results as they relate to firefighter safety and effectiveness. Appendix~\ref{sec:drawings} contains dimensioned drawings of the first and second floor of the structure.


\chapter{Summary of the Fire Incident}
\label{sec:incident_summary}

The account of events for this incident was documented by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) Fire Fighter Fatality Investigation and Prevention Program Report \#F2011-13~\cite{NIOSH:Bowyer2}. For the purpose of this analysis, the details regarding the timeline are considered to be approximate values. The following narrative of the incident was extracted from the NIOSH incident report~\cite{NIOSH:Bowyer2}:
\begin{quote}
On June 02, 2011, a 48 year-old career lieutenant and a 53 year-old fire fighter/paramedic died in a multi-level residential structure fire while searching for the seat of the fire. Note: The residential structure where the fatalities occurred was built on a significantly sloped hillside common throughout the city. The fire floor was one floor below street level. Six companies and three command chiefs were dispatched to a report of an electrical fire at a residential home.

When Engine~26, staffed with a lieutenant, fire fighter/paramedic, and driver arrived at approximately 1048 hours, they noticed light smoke showing as they made entry through the front door, side A, street level, of the building. Minutes later, the incident commander (IC) tried contacting them over the radio, but received no response. A battalion chief (BC) assigned to ``the fire attack group'' followed the hoseline through the door and spoke to the [lieutenant and fire fighter/paramedic] on the street level floor. The lieutenant stated to the BC that the fire must be a floor below them. The BC stated they would attack the fire from the [left side] of the structure and exited the front door. The [lieutenant and fire fighter/paramedic] did not follow. A few minutes later the IC again tried to contact Engine~26 via radio with no response.

The crew from Engine~24, assigned to back up Engine~26, and a split crew from Rescue~1 tried to make entry through the door in the garage but could not advance due to the heat. The BC went to the [door on the left side of the structure], located one floor below street level, and forced the door with the Engine~11 crew on the hoseline. They immediately felt a blast of heat from the fully involved basement area. The Rescue~1 crew backed out of the garage and re-entered on [the left side of the structure] after the Engine~11 crew knocked down the large room and contents fire. At about the same time, the Engine~24 crew also backed out of the garage and followed the Engine~26 crew's hoseline through the front door. In zero visibility conditions, separate members of the Engine~24 crew independently found a downed member of the Engine~26 crew.

The Incident Commander was alerted of a downed fire fighter but, did not initially realize, until moments later that it was actually two downed fire fighters. Both [fire fighters] were removed from the structure and immediate medical treatment was provided. The [fire fighters] were transported to the local medical center where the lieutenant was pronounced dead and the fire fighter/paramedic died two days later.
\end{quote}

\chapter{Model Description}
\label{sec:model_description}

Fire Dynamics Simulator~\cite{FDS_Users_Guide} is a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model that solves a form of the Navier-Stokes equations appropriate for low-speed, thermally driven flow with an emphasis on smoke and heat transport from fires. Within a CFD model, the room or building is divided into small three-dimensional rectangular control volumes or computational cells. The cells are contained together within one larger volume known as a computational domain. The CFD model computes the density, velocity, temperature, pressure, and species concentration of the gas in each cell. Based on the laws of conservation of mass, momentum, and energy, the model tracks the generation and movement of fire gasses. One of the most important advantages of FDS is that it is mathematically verified~\cite{FDS_Verification_Guide} and validated against fire test data to ensure that it provides the expected results, given sufficient input data~\cite{FDS_Validation_Guide}. A complete description of the FDS model is provided in the FDS Technical Reference Guide~\cite{FDS_Math_Guide}.

Smokeview is a software tool designed to visualize simulation results from FDS~\cite{Smokeview_Users_Guide}. Smokeview visualizes smoke and other attributes of the fire simulation using traditional scientific methods such as displaying tracer particle flow, two dimensional (2D) or three dimensional (3D) shaded contours of gas flow data such as temperature and flow vectors showing flow direction and magnitude. Smokeview allows the fire and fire movement to be visualized. This is done by displaying a series of partially transparent planes where the transparencies in each plane (at each grid node) are determined from soot densities computed by FDS. Smokeview also visualizes static data at particular times using 2D or 3D contours of data such as temperature and flow vectors showing flow direction and magnitude.

Input data from various sources must be collected and documented to simulate a fire using FDS or any other fire model. For the simulation results presented in this document, information was obtained from two primary sources. The following information was gathered from the fire scene: the geometry of the building and the compartments being modeled, the size and location of exterior and interior ventilation openings, and documentation of fire damage to the building. The following information was gathered from witnesses, first responders, reports, and recorded media such as fire ground radios or photographs: information on the timing of the fire development, the sequence and approximate timing of ventilation openings to the outside, and weather conditions at the time of the fire. 

The analysis of the simulation results is focused on the interior conditions on the first floor where the downed firefighters were located and the conditions that resulted in the establishment of a flow path in the interior stairwell leading into the basement. Based on the goals of the analysis and the information collected, several engineering approximations were made. For example, the fire was in the early growth stage when firefighters arrived~\cite{NIOSH:Bowyer2}; however, the exact ignition time, fire growth rate, and heat release rate (HRR) of the fire were not known. The ignition time, growth rate, and HRR were estimated were estimated using documentation of the potential fuel load within the structure.

In reality, the quantities associated with these input parameters are not fixed values; rather, a model input parameter can be thought of as a point estimate from a distribution of possible input parameters with some associated amount of uncertainty. Any change in an input parameter (such as the HRR) for a given scenario would result in a change in the output quantity (such as the hot gas layer (HGL) temperature). For example, according to the McCaffrey, Quintiere, and Harkleroad~\cite{SFPE:Walton} empirical correlation, the HGL temperature in a well-ventilated compartment fire is proportional to the HRR raised to the two-thirds power. Following this relationship, a 7.5~\% increase in the HRR would result in a 5~\% increase in the HGL temperature~\cite{NUREG_1824_Sup_1}. More detailed discussion on the propagation of parameter uncertainty in fire models is available in a validation study that was sponsored by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission~\cite{NUREG_1824_Sup_1}. The following subsections describe the inputs that were used to develop the simulation, including any approximations or assumptions that were made.

\section{Geometry}
\label{sec:geometry}

The structure involved in this fire incident was a four-story residential building with a flat roof that consisted of a bitumen membrane. The exterior was primarily stucco with large windows on the top three stories on the rear side of the structure. The right side of the structure shared a common fire wall with another residential structure. The structure had a 17.73~m (58~ft) by 8.53~m (28~ft) footprint and a height of 5.9~m (19~ft), as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:floor_plan}.

The structure was built on a sloped landscape such that, from the front side of the structure, two stories were located above the street level and two stories were located below the street level. The first and second floor (i.e., the two stories above street level) had a total interior floor area of 136~m$^2$ (1,468~ft$^2$). The interior walls were composed of gypsum board over insulated wood framing. The entrance stairs located on the front side of the structure led to the front door and an interior landing, which allowed access to the first floor (ten~stairs down) or the second floor (five~stairs up).

The basement (i.e., the first story below street level) had a total floor area of 121~m$^2$ (1301~ft$^2$) and consisted of a finished living area with a large utility area. A laundry area was located on a landing on the stairs between the first floor and basement. The basement was accessible via an exterior door on the left side of the structure and an interior set of stairs. The basement had a balcony on the exterior of the rear side of the structure. The sub-basement level (i.e., the second story below street level) was not connected to the other three levels of the house, contained no windows, and was only accessible via an exterior door of the left side of the structure. The exterior entrances to the basement and sub-basement levels were connected via exterior wooden stairs on the left side of the structure.

The fire, which is described in Section~\ref{sec:fires}, originated in the finished living room on the basement level (near the rear side of the structure), which had a floor area of 72~m$^2$ (775~ft$^2$). More detailed discussion on the impact of the fire on the interior conditions is provided in Section~\ref{sec:model_results}. Figure~\ref{fig:post_exterior} shows the exterior of the front and rear of the structure after the incident. Note that the majority of the exterior damage occurred above the openings located on the basement floor (where the wooden balcony is located). Fully dimensioned drawings of the second floor, first floor, and basement are shown in Figs.~\ref{fig:drawing_second_floor}, \ref{fig:drawing_first_floor} and \ref{fig:drawing_basement}, respectively.

\section{Fires}
\label{sec:fires}

To estimate the type of fuel, fire size, and structure ventilation, on-scene photographs and post-incident reports were used. Based on these sources of information, the FDS model includes three source fires: an initial couch fire in the basement, a secondary flashover fire that involved additional furniture items in the basement, and a third fire that occurred on the exterior basement balcony. The basement primarily contained upholstered polyurethane furniture fuel items, and the balcony was constructed of wood. The HRR of the initial couch fire is based on an experimentally measured HRR for a mattress fire~\cite{madrzykowski2009fire} to represent the fire growth rate of a similar household furniture item. The primary fuel packages were located in the basement as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:fuel_placement}. In this figure, the numbered labels indicate the order in which the fuel items were burning: 1) the initial couch fire, 2) the secondary furniture fuel items, and 3) the balcony fire.

Polyurethane fuel was specified for the interior basement fuel items, which can be represented by the chemical formula, $\C\H_{1.8}\O_{0.30}\N_{0.05}$, with specified product yields of soot ($y_{\mathrm{s}}=0.131 \; \mathrm{kg}/\mathrm{kg}$) and carbon monoxide ($y_{\mathrm{CO}}=0.010 \; \mathrm{kg}/\mathrm{kg}$)~\cite{SFPE:Tewarson}. The product yields are expressed in terms of the amount soot or carbon monoxide emitted per unit mass of fuel consumed~(kg/kg) and can be found in the Society of Fire Protection Engineers (SFPE) Handbook~\cite{SFPE:Tewarson}. A balanced chemical reaction for polyurethane combustion can be written as:

\begin{multline}
\C\H_{1.8}\O_{0.30}\N_{0.05} + 5.22(0.208\,\O_{2} + 0.783\,\N_{2} + 8.34 \times 10^{-3}\,\H_{2}\O + 3.87 \times 10^{-4}\,\C\O_{2}) \\
\rightarrow 6.06(0.129\,\C\O_{2} + 0.156\,\H_{2}\O + 0.001\,\C\O + 0.035\,\C + 0.679\,\N_{2})
\label{eq:fuel_polyurethane}
\end{multline}

Wood fuel was specified for the exterior basement balcony fuel items, which can be represented by the chemical formula, $\C\H_{1.7}\O_{0.74}\N_{0.002}$, with specified product yields of soot ($y_{\mathrm{s}}=0.015 \; \mathrm{kg}/\mathrm{kg}$) and carbon monoxide ($y_{\mathrm{CO}}=0.004 \; \mathrm{kg}/\mathrm{kg}$)~\cite{SFPE:Tewarson}. A balanced chemical reaction for wood combustion can be written as:

\begin{multline}
\C\H_{1.7}\O_{0.74}\N_{0.002} + 4.91(0.208\,\O_{2} + 0.783\,\N_{2} + 8.34 \times 10^{-3}\,\H_{2}\O + 3.87 \times 10^{-4}\,\C\O_{2}) \\
\rightarrow 5.74(0.168\,\C\O_{2} + 0.155\,\H_{2}\O + 6.37 \times 10^{-4}\,\C\O + 5.57 \times 10^{-3}\,\C + 0.670\,\N_{2})
\label{eq:fuel_wood}
\end{multline}

The heat of combustion of polyurethane and wood were specified as 26,200~kJ/kg and 16,400~kJ/kg, respectively, based on data provided in the SFPE Handbook~\cite{SFPE:Tewarson}. The heat of combustion quantifies the amount of energy released per unit mass of the fuel. The following text defines Eqs.~\ref{eq:fuel_polyurethane} and \ref{eq:fuel_wood} for an FDS input file with the desired fuel and reaction properties discussed above:

Note that using the input lines above will invoke the simple chemistry reaction mechanism in FDS in which fuel and air react to form only CO$_2$, CO, H$_2$O, soot, and N$_2$. If the inclusion of other combustion products is desired, then the user must explicitly define those species and the chemical reaction that produces them~\cite{FDS_Users_Guide}. Based on the above input lines, FDS uses the default, mixing-controlled fast chemistry combustion model. This mechanism states that the rate of fuel consumption is proportional to both the local limiting reactant concentration and the local rate of mixing and extinction is based on the critical flame temperature approach~\cite{FDS_Math_Guide}. While FDS provides users with the option to use a more complex finite-rate combustion mechanism, there is not sufficient evidence in this case to justify deviating from the default specifications.

\noindent The HRR for the various fuel packages was prescribed in FDS as follows.

\begin{enumerate}
\item For the inital couch fire in the basement, the HRR from 0~s to 327~s followed the experimentally measured mattress HRR. At 300~s, the HRR was approximately 3~MW. From 327~s until 540~s (the end of the simulation), the HRR was a constant 5~MW.

\item The secondary fuel packages in the basement were divided among four additional furniture items (two sofas, a lounge, and a chair). The two large sofas in the middle of the basement were specified with a peak HRR of 5~MW. The lounge and chair located at the perimeter of the basement were specified with a peak HRR of 2~MW. From 0~s to 300~s, these items were not burning. From 300~s to 342~s (the time at which the first basement window failed), the secondary fuel items were ignited, and the total HRR of the secondary fuel packages increased linearly from 0~MW to 14~MW. From 342~s to 540~s (the end of the simulation), the HRR was a constant 14~MW.

\item The third exterior fuel item included the wood on the basement balcony and siding. From 0~s to 440~s, these items were not burning. From 440~s to 450~s, the exterior basement balcony was ignited, and the total HRR increased linearly from 0~MW to 1~MW. To estimate the heat release rate per unit area (HRRPUA) of wood, Babrauskas and Grayson~\cite{babrauskas1990} conducted experiments in a cone calorimeter\footnote{The cone calorimeter is an experimental apparatus used to gather data about ignition time, mass loss, combustion products, and heat release rate among other properties associated with burning small samples of materials~\cite{ASTM:E1355}.} to determine the 5-min average of the HRRPUA for several different types of wood over a range of radiant heat fluxes. The results of that study indicate that the HRRPUA for different types of wood is approximately 50~kW/m$^2$.
\end{enumerate}

Figure~\ref{fig:hrr} shows the prescribed design fire for this scenario, which is the sum of the HRRs of the three source fires. In this figure, the text labels indicate the three stages of the fire based on the contribution of the fuel packages. Therefore, the estimated maximum specified fire size for this structure was approximately 20~MW. Note that the prescribed HRR can be different than the simulated HRR calculated by FDS based on the amount of available fuel, oxygen, and ventilation. A comparison of the prescribed HRR and the simulated HRR is discussed in Section~\ref{sec:HRR}.

Since the time at which the fire started is not known relative to the notification of a fire or how fast the fire spread, several simplifying assumptions were made. The first assumption is that the initial couch fire in the basement was specified to start at the beginning of the simulation. The second assumption is that the sources of the gas phase polyurethane and wood fuel have constant areas at fixed locations (five furniture items in the basement interior for the polyurethane fuel, and the exterior basment balcony for the wood fuel). The following lines define the source fires in the FDS input file:

\begin{lstlisting}
&SURF ID='COUCH_RIGHT_INITIAL',
    SPEC_ID='POLYURETHANE',
    MASS_FLUX = 5.271815E-6,
    RAMP_MF='COUCH_RIGHT_INITIAL_RAMP' /

&SURF ID='COUCH_MIDDLE_FLASHOVER',
    SPEC_ID='POLYURETHANE',
    MASS_FLUX = 1.037172E-5,
    RAMP_MF='COUCH_MIDDLE_FLASHOVER_RAMP' /

&SURF ID='COUCH_LEFT_FLASHOVER',

    SPEC_ID='WOOD',
    MASS_FLUX = 0.003049,
    RAMP_MF='WOOD_EXTERIOR_RAMP' /
\end{lstlisting}
Note that the mass flux values here are unique for each fuel item and are specific to the input files used for these simulations. The key point is that each fuel item was modeled as a 3D object with flat surfaces from which a specified amount of fuel flows, mixes with air, and burns.

\section{Materials}
\label{sec:materials}

While the fires were represented as fuel sources with a constant area (Section~\ref{sec:fires}), from a heat transfer perspective, it is important to define the material properties (density, thermal conductivity, and specific heat) to account for heat transfer and energy storage in the ceiling, walls, and floor. In this study, the material properties of gypsum board~\cite{WAKILI2007} were specified on the finished walls and ceilings of the structure. The following lines define the gypsum material and surface in the FDS input file:

\begin{lstlisting}
&MATL ID          = 'GYPSUM'
    FYI           = 'Wakili - Journal of Fire Sciences 2007' 
    CONDUCTIVITY  = 0.28
    SPECIFIC_HEAT = 1.00
    DENSITY       = 810. /

&SURF ID      = 'WALL'
    DEFAULT   = .TRUE.
    COLOR     = 'DARK SEA GREEN 4'
    MATL_ID   = 'GYPSUM'
    THICKNESS = 0.012 /
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Ventilation}
\label{sec:ventilation}

The simulations in this study account for changes in the ventilation due to a combination of fire department operations (opening doors) and fire acting on the structure (fire breaching walls, breaking windows, etc). The ventilation times and ventilation areas represent our best understanding of the incident. The times of ventilation changes for doors and windows are provided in Table~\ref{tab:ventilation_timeline}.

During the time at which the downed firefighters were located, the state of some windows and doors in the structure was known, which resulted in the establishment of a flow path in the interior stairwell leading into the basement. However, the exact time of operation for other doors was not known. Therefore, the following doors were assumed to be open at the start of the simulation: 1) the front door, 2) the interior door leading from the hallway on the first floor into the stairwell towards the basement, 3) the door leading from the garage into the first floor landing, and 4) the overhead garage door. The basement windows and exterior door were specified to open at certain times based on observations of failure (i.e., window breakage) or fire department operations (i.e., forcible entry) from on-scene photographs and post-incident reports.

Structure leakage has been shown to be important when modeling enclosure fires~\cite{beal2009}. The open front door at the start of the simulation and the vents created during the simulation are significantly larger than the total effective area of leakage of a structure of this type. Therefore, any leakage in the structure would have a negligible impact on the fluid mechanics within the structure and is not included in this study.

\section{Numerical Mesh}
\label{sec:numerical_mesh}

For the simulation, a measure of how well the flow field is resolved can be estimated by using the non-dimensional expression $D^*/\dx$. Here, $D^*$ is the characteristic fire diameter, $\dx$ is the nominal size of a mesh cell, and $\dQ$ is the total heat release rate of the fire:
\begin{equation}
D^* = \left(
     \frac{\dQ}{\rho_\infty \, c_p \, T_\infty \, \sqrt{g}}
     \right)^\frac{2}{5} 
\label{eq:mesh}
\end{equation}
From the FDS User's Guide~\cite{FDS_Users_Guide}, the characteristic fire diameter is related to the characteristic fire size via the relation $Q^* = (D^*/D)^{5/2}$. Here, $D$ is the physical diameter of the base of the fire specified in the simulation. Following Eq.~\ref{eq:mesh} and using a grid cell size of 10~cm, the characteristic fire diameter to cell size ($D^*/\dx$) ratio is 18.8 for the initial couch fire (peak HRR of 5.4~MW) and 28.3 for the basement flashover fire (HRR of 15~MW). Based on validation work performed for the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, $D^*/\dx$ values ranged between 4 and 16~\cite{NUREG_1824} and produced results that were adequate for engineering calculations. The grid resolution used in this model is within or exceeds typical engineering $D^*/\dx$ values.

As discussed in Section~\ref{sec:geometry}, the structure had exterior dimensions of 17.73~m (58~ft) by 8.53~m (28~ft) and a total height of 5.9~m (19~ft). To ensure adequately resolved fluid flow in and out of the structure, the computational domain was extended beyond the volume of the structure. The total volume of the computational domain was 17~m (56~ft) by 22~m (72~ft) by 13.6~m (45~ft). A grid resolution of 10~cm (3.9~in) was used, which required approximately 5.1 million computational cells. As a result, all of the input model geometry lengths, ventilation openings (holes, doors, and windows), and fire areas will snap to the nearest 10~cm. Figure~\ref{fig:SMV_exterior_grid} shows the front of the structure rendered in Smokeview with the 10~cm mesh.

\caption{Front (left) and rear (right) of the structure with a 10~cm computational mesh.}
\label{fig:SMV_exterior_grid}
\end{figure}

The domain was divided into 16 meshes (each containing between 272,000 and 367,200 grid cells) that could be processed in parallel, which reduced the amount of required calculation time to approximately 3~days. Figure~\ref{fig:mult_mesh} shows the entire structure within the computational domain that has been divided into multiple meshes. Table~\ref{tab:model_parameters} shows a summary of the model input parameters for the simulations that were conducted as part of this study.

\section{Heat Release Rate}
\label{sec:HRR}

The HRR output quantity from FDS represents the predicted amount of combustion that would have occurred in the fire scenario, which depends on the amount of available fuel, oxygen, and ventilation. In the FDS simulations, a prescribed HRR is specified, and FDS determines the amount of combustion that occurs throughout the simulation based on the amount of available fuel and oxygen at a given location. As a result, the actual HRR in FDS can be lower than the specified HRR based on the ventilation conditions.

Figure~\ref{fig:hrr_w_fds} shows the prescribed HRR vs. time based on the specified fires along with the FDS results for the two ventilation scenarios that were described in Section~\ref{sec:ventilation}. The vertical line represents the time at which the first basement window on the rear side of the structure failed (342~s). The maximum size of the fire used in this study was selected such that the conditions would become ventilation limited to minimize computational time while aligning with the timeline observations from the fire scenario. Note that the rear window failures were driven by the event timeline rather than failure temperature criteria.

\begin{figure}[!ht]

\caption[HRR vs. time from the FDS simulations.]
{HRR vs. time from the FDS simulations. The vertical line indicates the time at which the rear basement windows began to fail (342~s).}
\label{fig:hrr_w_fds}
\end{figure}

In Fig.~\ref{fig:hrr}, the XX line represents the FDS simulation. The XX line represents the prescribed HRR that was input into FDS. As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:hrr}, the HRR output from FDS is less than the prescribed HRR because the fire in the structure becomes ventilation limited. The maximum HRR value is approximately XX~MW before the fire becomes ventilation limited and begins to decay. The HRR is reduced to XX~MW as the amount of oxygen inside the structure becomes limited. There is an insufficient amount of oxygen in the structure to burn all of the fuel, therefore combustion occurs locally at the ventilation openings where fresh air is available. Figure~\ref{fig:smv_ext_fire} shows flaming combustion through the failed window on the rear side of the structure and attic breach just after the second fire ignites at XX~s. After additional window failures occur at XX~s and XX~s (see Table~\ref{tab:ventilation_timeline}), the abrupt change in ventilation causes the HRR to increase to XX~MW before it decreases to approximately XX~MW. The HRR then increases towards a steady-state value.

% Figure~\ref{fig:hrr} indicates that the HRRs for both of the ventilation scenarios in FDS are identical until 130~s (HRR $\approx$ 7~MW). At 130~s, the rear door is opened in the baseline simulation. At 135~s, there is an additional breach on the left side of the structure (Table~\ref{tab:ventilation_timeline}). The open door and breach act as additional pressure releases for the structure. Again, the abrupt change in ventilation causes the HRR to increase from approximately 7~MW to 9.7~MW at 139~s. At the time of the door failure (160~s), the HRR in both cases was approximately 9~MW because of the increased amount of ventilation. While there might be some locally different burning characteristics between the baseline simulation and the alternative simulation, the interior conditions in both cases presented a significant hazard to firefighters inside of the structure. Therefore, the analysis will focus on the results of the baseline simulation.

% \end{figure}

\section{Pressure}
\label{sec:pressure}

% As the simulated fire grows in the attic and rear porch, the pressure rises. Figure~\ref{fig:pres_159s} shows the calculated pressure conditions in the structure just before the interior door failed in the simulation. On the rear porch, the pressure rise ranges from a 4~Pa ($5.8 \times 10^{-4}$~psi) over-pressure at a height of 1~m to greater than 10~Pa ($1.5 \times 10^{-3}$~psi) at the ceiling. Gases at an elevated pressure will always move towards a region of lower pressure. The door serves as a boundary between the high and low pressure regions. Once the door fails open, the high pressure gases flow towards the low pressure regions in the house, hallway, kitchen, and front stairwell. The velocity vectors shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:velo_175s} (15~s after the interior door fails) indicate the direction of flow within the structure.

\section{Temperature}
\label{sec:temperature}

% Analysis of the temperatures from the FDS simulation focuses on the high hazard areas of the structure: the attic, the rear porch and stairwell, and the interior hallway which connects the rear porch to the front stairwell. The temperature profile at these high hazard areas is shown via several snapshots in time to illustrate the change in the interior conditions. The first snapshots are shown at a time of 129~s into the simulation, just before a firefighter opened the rear porch door (as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:temp_129s}), and 159~s into the simulation, just before the interior door fails (as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:temp_159s}).

% \caption{FDS simulated temperature contours, 1~s prior to interior door failure.}
% \label{fig:temp_159s}
% \end{figure}

% Figure~\ref{fig:temp_129s} shows temperatures of at least 260~$^{\circ}$C (500~$^{\circ}$F) in the second floor rear porch and rear portion of the attic. High temperatures, between 80~$^{\circ}$C (185~$^{\circ}$F) and 200~$^{\circ}$C (390~$^{\circ}$F), also extend down to the rear entrance on the first floor. Before the interior door fails (Fig.~\ref{fig:temp_159s}), the inflow of ambient air from the open rear door reduces the temperatures near the interior doorway, but at the same time, the HRR increases because of the additional ventilation, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:hrr}. As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:temp_161s}, after the second floor interior door fails, the high temperature gas that filled the rear porch flows in the direction of lower pressure (i.e., towards the front door). Note that the conditions in the attic do not appear to change.

% As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:temp_175s}, 15~s after the door failed, high temperature gases descended to approximately 1~m (3.28~ft) above the floor through the interior hallway and are flowing into the kitchen.


\chapter{Discussion of Simulation Results}
\label{sec:discussion}

% The results of the FDS simulations are discussed in the following two sections. The first section addresses the results of the computational modeling as they relate to the interior hallways conditions. The second section examines the model results and observed outcomes of the fire incident as they relate to tactics discussed in recent experimental research. 

\section{Simulated Hallway Flow Path}
\label{sec:simulated_flow_path}

% From on-scene reports (Section~\ref{sec:incident_summary}) and the FDS simulation results (Section~\ref{sec:temperature}), the interior conditions on the second floor of the structure were initially tenable. From the NIOSH report~\cite{NIOSH:Bowyer2}, while the IC was inside the structure on the second floor, only light haze and a glow around the door between the hallway and enclosed porch was observed. This indicated the presence of fire in the area of the enclosed porch. The simulation results indicate a high hazard area (temperatures greater than 260~$^{\circ}$C or 500~$^{\circ}$F) in the attic and the enclosed porch at this time. By the time the E123 captain and firefighter arrived on the second floor (Table~\ref{tab:combined_timeline}) and approached the rear of the structure, the rear porch was fully involved. Temperature conditions greater than 260~$^{\circ}$C (500~$^{\circ}$F) were present on the porch side of the steel-faced, wood-framed door at the rear of the structure. Exposure to these conditions likely weakened the structural integrity of the door, which may have led to a partial failure (Table~\ref{tab:combined_timeline}). Figure~\ref{fig:chicago_doorfold} shows the state of the rear door after the fire. Note the large crease in the steel face of the door just above the knob.

% \begin{figure}[!ht]
% \includegraphics[width=6.5in]{../Figures/Porch_Door_1}
% \caption{Post-fire image of interior door.}
% \label{fig:chicago_doorfold}
% \end{figure}

% After the interior door failed, an interior flow path was created from the enclosed porch area into the kitchen of the structure. This resulted in a rapid change in the conditions within the flow path. The combustion gases at elevated temperature and pressure in the enclosed porch were vented by the failure of the door and flowed towards lower pressure areas in the hallways and kitchen. The arrows shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:flowpath_1} summarize the simulated flow direction of gases on the second floor after the door failure. In this figure, the red arrows indicate elevated gas temperatures, and the blue arrows indicate relatively cooler gas temperatures. The arrow that transitions from red to blue indicates that the heated gases were cooling as they flowed away from the fire towards the front of the structure. The two arrows located at the door on the second floor (towards the front of the structure) indicate bi-directional flow. At that doorway, cool ambient air flowed towards the fire near the bottom of the door, and hot gases flowed away from the fire near the top of the door.

\section{Assessing the Hazard}
\label{sec:assessing_the_hazard}

A person is susceptible to second-degree burn injuries if exposed to temperatures greater than 55~$^{\circ}$C (130~$^{\circ}$F)~\cite{contactburn}. Although firefighters wear protective gear, gear only offers a finite amount of protection. The polycarbonate in a self contained breathing apparatus begins to soften when the material temperature reaches approximately 140~$^{\circ}$C (284~$^{\circ}$F)~\cite{mensch2011emergency}. Structural fire fighting coats and pants are tested to withstand temperatures of 260~$^{\circ}$C (500~$^{\circ}$F)~\cite{nfpa2013standard}. Prolonged exposure to elevated temperatures can result in a significant amount of heat transferred to the firefighter, putting him/her at risk. Exposure of equipment to temperatures of 260~$^{\circ}$C (500~$^{\circ}$F) represents a Class III exposure~\cite{Donnelly2006}. Firefighters are at increased risk levels when encountering Class III exposure conditions for more than 5~minutes~\cite{Donnelly2006}. Therefore, for the analysis of the simulated exposure temperatures, the maximum visualized temperature is set to indicate all values that are greater than or equal to 260~$^{\circ}$C (500~$^{\circ}$F). This means that temperatures visualized at the maximum range in the displayed model output are at a minimum of 260~$^{\circ}$C (500~$^{\circ}$F); the actual simulated temperatures could in fact be greater. 

% Prior to the interior door failure, the elevated temperatures on the second floor were limited to the rear porch, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:temp_top_159}. The temperatures were greatest at the back-left corner where there is sufficient oxygen due to the section of porch wall that had burned away and allowed additional oxygen to mix with the fuel-rich fire gases. Five seconds after the interior door failed, hot gases traveled the length of the interior hallway and approached the doorway into the kitchen, which was approximately 4.5~m (14.8~ft) away from the source fire, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:temp_top_165}. Within 60~s of the interior door failure, the hallway temperatures were approximately at or above 260~$^{\circ}$C (500~$^{\circ}$F) throughout the hallway, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:temp_top_220}. These results indicate that the high temperature gases seen 5~s after failure were not just a burst but rather the front of a sustained exhaust gas flow from the fire burning in the enclosed rear porch. The conditions in this hallway changed from tenable to high-hazard very rapidly following the door failure. Figure~\ref{fig:temp_top_220} also shows that the temperatures in the kitchen were at or below 90~$^{\circ}$C (194~$^{\circ}$F), and the temperatures at the top of the stairs were at or below 70~$^{\circ}$C (158~$^{\circ}$F). At these locations within the structure, the exhaust gases in the flow path were cooled and diluted by the inflowing ambient gas. These simulated temperatures are consistent with the post-incident conditions that were documented in the kitchen and second floor stairwell.

\section{Tactical Considerations}
\label{sec:tactical_condsiderations}

There have been many previous fire incidents~\cite{NIOSH:Pettit,NIOSH:Washenitz,NIOSH:Mezzanotte,NIOSH:McFall,NIOSH:McFall2,NIOSH:McFall3,NIOSH:Berardinelli,NIOSH:Koedam,NIOSH:McFall4,NIOSH:Tarley,NIOSH:Braddee,NIOSH:Merinar,NIOSH:Bowyer2,NIOSH:Loflin,NIOSH:Bowyer} in which changes in the flow paths are thought to have had an adverse impact on firefighter and occupant safety. Table~\ref{tab:LODD} lists the NIOSH investigation reports from the past 15 years in which it could be determined that a flow path played a role in the related incident. This table lists the NIOSH investigation number, the outcome, and a brief description of the flow path details.

Based on a review of these incidents, it is clear that fires with rapidly developing or changing flow paths are a significant hazard to the fire service. The development of (or changes to) a flow path could be caused by the failure of a component of the structure, such as a door, window, or portion of a ceiling, wall or floor. Environmental conditions such as wind can generate hazardous thermal conditions within a flow path. Uncoordinated ventilation can also be the cause of increased thermal hazards within a flow path. 

% In this fire incident, the thermal degradation of the steel-faced, wood-framed door resulted in a rapid change in the thermal conditions in the hallway, which resulted in highly hazardous conditions. These conditions would be equivalent to or greater than a Class III exposure~\cite{Donnelly2006}. Prediction of the failure mode and failure time of the door is not a reasonable expectation given the large number of unknowns that the firefighters faced on the fire ground. In this case, the timing of the interior attack appears to have coincided with the failure time of the door. Research has been conducted~\cite{madrzykowski2009fire, kerber2009fire} and continues to be conducted by NIST, Underwriters Laboratories (UL), and others that demonstrates that applying water from the exterior into the fire area of a structure (prior to the start of interior operations) can significantly improve the safety of firefighters by reducing the thermal hazard from the fire and reducing the potential for developing high velocity hot gas flows within the structure.

\chapter{Summary}
\label{sec:summary}

% NIST's Fire Dynamics Simulator was used to provide insight into the fire dynamics within a 2~\sfrac{1}{2}~story single family structure in Chicago, IL, that resulted in the death the captain of a fire department. The fuel, fire size, and fire growth rate that were used in the FDS simulations were estimated by taking into account all of the available information including the NIOSH post-incident report~\cite{NIOSH:Bowyer2}, post-incident pictures, videos, and relevant literature. This resulted in a specified source fire of 12.3~MW in the attic and rear porch of the structure. However, based on the limited ventilation conditions in the attic and enclosed porch, the FDS simulation results indicated a maximum HRR of approximately 9~MW as a result of the limited supply of oxygen.

% The fire started in the attic and spread down into the enclosed porch on the rear of the structure. The spread of fire and hot gases into the second floor of the structure was limited by a closed steel-faced, wood-framed door that was located between the enclosed porch and the hallway. After exposure to the elevated temperatures and pressure from the fire in the porch area, the wood frame of the door decomposed and the steel faces of the door failed and collapsed inward. The door failure resulted in the establishment of a flow path between the higher pressure and higher temperature conditions in the enclosed porch and the lower pressure and lower temperature conditions in the hallway and kitchen areas of the second floor. The temperature of the gases that flowed into the hallway at face height was calculated to exceed 260~$^{\circ}$C (500~$^{\circ}$F). Unfortunately, a captain and firefighter were advancing a hose line in the hallway at the time of the door failure. The captain was overcome by the rapid change in conditions before he could exit to the safety of the kitchen area. After a Mayday call, the captain was rescued from the structure but later succumbed to his injuries.

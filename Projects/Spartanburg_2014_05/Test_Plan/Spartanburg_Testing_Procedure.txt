=================================
=================================

===================
= Initial Startup =
===================

* Power on:
    * Uninterruptible Power Supplies (UPSs)
    * WiFi routers/repeaters
    * Arduino laptop with NTP, RabbitMQ, Python receive_data.py script
    * DAQs and laptops
    * Gas analyzers (leave running as long as possible during testing)
    * Weather stations
    * Digital video recorder (DVR)
    * Bullet cameras
    * Thermal imaging cameras (TICs) (check battery level)
    * Digital video cassette recorders (DVCRs) (check battery level)
    * GoPros (check battery level)
    * Video cameras (check battery level)

===============
= Calibration =
===============

* Verify operation of all:
    * Video channels
    * DAQ channels
    * Check toggle switches on TC-2095s for appropriate measurement device
    * Gas analyzers

* Calibrate gas analyzers with zero and span gases

* Check lag time on gas analyzer probes

* 1 minute calibration run to separate output file (cover BDPs, check TCs, etc.)

=============================
= Primary Testing Procedure =
=============================

* Verify testing procedure with all personnel

* Safety checks

* Take GigaPan picture before test

* Distribute still cameras

* Power on gas analyzer pump

* Turn on water for heat flux gauges

* Check Arduino battery level
* Power on Arduino data loggers

* Start recording on:
    * DAQ data
    * DVR
    * GoPros
    * Video cameras
    * Mobile TIC

* 1 minute pre-test run (with all doors closed)

* Begin test

* Follow testing procedure

* End test

* Stop recording on:
    * DAQ data
    * DVR
    * GoPros
    * Video cameras
    * Mobile TIC

* Power off gas analyzer pump

* Power off Arduino data loggers

* Verify successful recording and operation of all DAQ channels in output file

* Take GigaPan picture after test

* Prepare for next test

=============
= Data Dump =
=============

* Collect and organize data from:
    * DAQ
    * DVR
    * GoPros
    * Video cameras with digital media
    * Still cameras with digital media
    * Mobile TIC
    * GigaPan
    * Weather station data logger
    * Arduinos

* Archive, swap, and label tapes from video cameras and DVCRs as needed

* Make copies of all data on external hard drives

* Verify integrity of data

* Format GoPros, video and still camera media, mobile TIC, Arduinos, and GigaPan camera

* On return from trip, extract video from DVCR tapes

====================
= Battery Charging =
====================

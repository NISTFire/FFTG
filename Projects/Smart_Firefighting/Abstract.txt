Challenges and Technology Plan for Smart Fire Fighting

Smart fire fighting technologies are being developed to address issues in fireground operations related to situational awareness and tactical decision-making. The technology plan for smart fire fighting includes the development of sensors for firefighters, fire apparatus, and building systems. A framework is being developed that includes various sensors, wireless transmission of data, real-time processing of data, model predictions and forecasts of the fire environment, and information flow to support fireground operations for real-time decision making. The framework developed in this project will be used as a platform to increase the level of knowledge in the fire service in terms of fire behavior and new technologies.

Some challenges during firefighting operations that can be addressed using smart fire fighting technologies include guidance on where to focus search and rescue operations, decreasing the time to initiate tactical suppression operations, detecting and predicting rapid changes in ventilation, and avoiding areas of immediate danger to life and health. An important aspect in the development of smart fire fighting technologies is the interoperability of sensor devices and centralized, real-time analysis of data collected from the field in hazardous environments. To facilitate device interoperability, these sensors are being developed on top of open source hardware (Arduino) and software (Python, Advanced Message Queueing Protocol). As a first approach, a water flow sensor is being developed to record and wirelessly transmit fire water flow and pressure data from fire pumpers and hose lines. These sensors will be tested during upcoming field experiments and can provide valuable information about the time and amount of water that flows during suppression operations in actual fire suppression scenarios.

- Open the .ipt (3D model file) and the .idw (2D drawing file) files corresponding to the desired structure

- Notice, the initial .idw file contains all dimensions for the structure, instrumentation, and fuel load

- To edit this, switch to the .ipt file. On the left menu bar, sort the list such that the item(s) you wish to remove from the dimensioned view are at the bottom of the list.

- Move the 'End of Part' icon above the last item you wish to remove from the dimensioned view.

- Switch back to the .idw file. In the left menu bar under the line beginning with 'VIEW#:', delete the sketch(es) corresponding to the items you want removed.

- Verify that the items have been removed from the floor plan view and update dimensions as desired.

- Click on file (the orange 'I' in the top left of the window) -> Export -> PDF and save file as desired.

- After exporting the PDF, close the .idt and .idw files WITHOUT SAVING -- By default, the .idw and .ipt files should contain all the items corresponding to the structure

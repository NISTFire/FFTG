Process for generating floor plans to be presented in LaTeX file:

	########## Sensor labels ##########

		- Generate sensor notation by creating a sketch UNDER THE VIEW tab. (Note, if sketch generated under drawing but not under the view, the following dimensions will not scale correctly)

		Temperatures: 
			- Circle with diameter of 12 in
			- Fill/Hatch region using lightest shade of red under the basic colors option

		BDPs
			- 45-45-90 triangle with 12 in length sides
			- Fill/Hatch region using light blue color located in the top row of the basic color options

		- If multiple sensors in single spot, place them on top of each other, starting with the sensor listed first in the list above (ie, TC/BDP combo would show a red circle with blue triangle on top of it)

		- Sketch line weight: 0.020 in

		- All label font: Tahoma, bolded, 0.120 in

	########## Drawing Positioning ##########

	Scale drawing to 1/48

	Align East edge of 2ft wall with edge of the tail of the bottom arrow from border design.

	Align South edge of 2ft wall with left border line.

	If desired, add units. Both unit numbers should be centered, the East-West dimension should be dragged out to left edge of page, and the North-South unit should be dragged up until it auto-snaps into place.

	If desired, generate a leader text arrow with letter 'N' (0.240pt font, bolded) to indicate North direction. To align leader text, align the bottom of the 'N' with the top of the 'B' from the border design, the left side of the 'N' with the North edge of the 2ft wall, and drag the tip of the arrow to the right border line.

	If drawing is of second level of West Structure, remove the visibility of the 2ft wall outline around the drawing.

	Delete "Default Border" from drawing.

	Export drawing as PDF, save, and then select undo twice so border outline reappears and save .idw file

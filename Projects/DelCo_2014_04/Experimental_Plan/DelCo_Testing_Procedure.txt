= Initial Startup =
===================

* Power on:
    * Uninterruptible Power Supplies (UPSs)
    * WiFi routers
    * DAQs and laptops
    * Arduino laptop with NTP, RabbitMQ, Python receive_data.py script
    * Digital video recorder (DVR)
    * Bullet cameras
    * Thermal imaging cameras (TICs) (check battery level)
    * Digital video cassette recorders (DVCRs) (check battery level)
    * GoPros (check battery level)
    * Video cameras (check battery level)

===============
= Calibration =
===============

* Verify operation of all:
    * Video channels - Jay/Kris - Keith 
    * DAQ channels - Roy/Craig - Keith
    * Check toggle switches on TC-2095s for appropriate measurement device

* 1 minute calibration run to separate output file (cover BDPs)

=============================
= Primary Testing Procedure =
=============================

* Verify testing procedure with all personnel
* Safety checks

* Check Arduino battery level
* Power on Arduino data loggers

* Start recording on:
    * GoPros
    * Video cameras
    * DVCRs (Mobile TIC)

* Start synced recording on:    [MARK DATE/TIME]
    * DVR
    * DAQ data 

* 1 minute pre-test run

* Begin test                    [MARK DATE/TIME]

* Follow testing procedure

* End test                      [MARK DATE/TIME]

* Stop synced recording on:     [MARK DATE/TIME]
    * DAQ
    * DVR

* Stop recording on:
    * GoPros
    * Video cameras
    * DVCRs (Mobile TIC)

* Power off Arduino data loggers

* Verify successful recording and operation of all DAQ channels in output file

* Prepare for next test

=============
= Data Dump =
=============

* Retrieve data from:
    * DAQ
    * DVR
    * GoPros
    * Video cameras with digital media
    * Arduinos

* Swap and label tapes from video cameras and DVCRs as needed

* Make 3 copies of all data on external hard drives

* Verify integrity of data

* On return from trip, extract video from DVCRs

====================
= Battery Charging =
====================

* Charge all batteries on:
    * Laptops
    * Arduinos
    * Bullet camera batteries
    * TICs
    * GoPros

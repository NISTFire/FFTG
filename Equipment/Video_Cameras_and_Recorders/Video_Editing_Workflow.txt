=== Video Editing Workflow ===

== Digital Video Recorder ==

1. Record video.
2. Backup the video to an external drive to .avi format (H.264 codec and AVI container).
3. Convert the .avi videos to .mp4 format (H.264 codec and MPEG-4 container) for editing. A tool such as Handbrake is recommended.

It is recommended that you maintain the original .avi files and subtitle files, which contain the date/timestamp information for future reference.

== Combining Videos ==

The GoPro cameras and DVR split long videos into multiple files.

If you need to combine multiple .mp4 videos into one file, you can use a tool such as MP4Box or Avidemux.

Multiple video files can also result from the DVR if a video channel loses signal temporarily. If this is the case, be sure to add blank video to pad any time that passed while the video channel signal was lost.

== Creating Multi-Camera Videos ==

You can combine multiple videos into a multi-camera video using software such as Adobe Premiere.

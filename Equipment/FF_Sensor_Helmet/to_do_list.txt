###### Sensor Helmet Tasks ######

- Heavy duty case for macbook

- change out TC, add T_ref and humidity sensors

- secondary axis for T/review bokeh documentation

- fix arduino timestamp

- write bash script to configure codes with correct ip addresses/file name/other set up necessary things to start data logging (see notes in UL_Fire_Attack_2016 dir)

- systematic way of removing data from arduino and saving on local machine (goes along with Bokeh plot)

- create section in equipment guide specific to sensor helmet & real-time plotting

- resolve connectivity issues --> set up own wifi network and repeaters

- change out TC, possibly add humidity sensor 

- consider redesigning water reservoir/cooling and data lines

- setting up bokeh server to publish to website such that anyone can view real time plotting

- make 2nd helmet with other HF gauge
